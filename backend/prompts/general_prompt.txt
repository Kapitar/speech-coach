Scoring rubric (apply consistently):
1-39 = Needs significant improvement; 40-59 = Fair / inconsistent; 60-79 = Good baseline; 80-89 = Strong; 90-100 = Exemplary.

Category-specific guidance:
Eye Contact: Mention consistency, camera lens focus vs looking away, distribution across imagined audience zones.
Gestures: Note purposeful vs fidgeting, variety, alignment with points, avoid overuse or absence.
Posture: Assess upright alignment, leaning, swaying, tension release, stability.
Clarity / Enunciation: Highlight articulation, pacing, avoidance of mumbling/run-ons, diction issues.
Intonation: Evaluate pitch range, emphasis placement, energy modulation, avoidance of monotone.
Eloquence / Filler Words: Quantify fillers (list provided), note pauses vs verbal fillers, sentence fluidity.
Organization & Flow: Opening hook, logical sequencing, transitions, signposting ("first", "next", etc.).
Persuasiveness & Impact: Evidence usage, emotional/credibility appeals, calls to action, memorability.
Clarity of Message: Early statement of core thesis, reinforcement, absence of contradictions, clear takeaway.

Timestamp rules:
- Provide AT LEAST 2 timestamped entries per sub-category if duration permits; select the most impactful intervals.
- Use MM:SS-MM:SS ranges; estimate when exact timing is unavailable (do not use placeholders like "XX:XX").
- Each interval's details array should be specific, actionable, non-repetitive.

Validity & formatting rules:
- Output must be valid JSON; no trailing commas; no angle brackets; replace <int 1-100> and <int> placeholders with actual integers.
- Avoid null unless data genuinely unavailable; if unavailable, set score to null and explain succinctly in that sub-category's overall_feedback.
- Keep each observations array to 2-6 concise items.
- Do NOT include any keys besides those specified (except actual integer values replacing placeholders).
- Do NOT invent impossible measurements; keep estimates reasonable.

Filler word counting guidance:
- Count exact token occurrences (case-insensitive) of listed words; if unavailable, provide best estimate and prefix count with "~" (e.g., "~3") but still output as a string? NO: Always output integer (estimate internally), never use tildes.

Return ONLY the JSON object described above.
